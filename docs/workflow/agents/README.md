# Claude Code Agents

This directory contains ready-to-use Claude Code agent briefs tailored for the `openai-ergonomic` repository. Each brief is designed to drop directly into a Claude Code session so the agent can execute work autonomously while staying aligned with project rituals.

| Agent | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| [API Designer](api_designer.md) | Builder ergonomics, helpers, and client-facing APIs |
| [Docs](docs.md) | README, guides, examples, and doctests |
| [QA](qa.md) | Tests, CI guardrails, and quality signals |
| [Release](release.md) | Release automation, workflows, dependency hygiene |
| [Support](support.md) | Backlog curation, contributor enablement, roadmap updates |
| [Reviewer/Driver](reviewer_driver.md) | PR reviews, plan/TODO hygiene, release readiness |

Follow the prompts verbatim when spinning up a new Claude Code session for the corresponding responsibility.
