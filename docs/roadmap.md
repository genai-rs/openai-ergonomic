# OpenAI Ergonomic - Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for `openai-ergonomic`, including short-term goals, mid-term objectives, and long-term vision. It serves as a guide for contributors and a reference for project planning.

## Project Vision

**Mission**: Provide the most ergonomic and developer-friendly Rust wrapper around the OpenAI API, making it easy for Rust developers to integrate AI capabilities into their applications.

**Core Values**:
- **Ergonomic First**: Prioritize developer experience over implementation complexity
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time correctness
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Support all OpenAI endpoints with consistent patterns
- **Production Ready**: Ship with testing, documentation, and reliability built-in
- **Community Driven**: Welcome contributions and maintain open development practices

## Current Status (September 2025)

We now have:
- ✅ Full repository scaffolding with CI/CD and release automation
- ✅ Core ergonomic builders for responses, chat, assistants, vector stores, batches, files, moderations, and more
- ✅ 26 curated examples across quickstarts, extended workflows, and advanced scenarios
- ✅ Comprehensive testing harness (unit, integration, doctest, smoke toggles)
- ✅ Agent-first workflow documentation (`AUTOMATION_AGENTS.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, publish checklist)

**Active Development**: Polishing advanced guides, filling remaining builder gaps (audio/images/embeddings), and preparing the v0.3.0 release candidate.
